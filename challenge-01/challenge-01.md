## The challenge

Subject of this challenge is to setup a production ready and developer friendly Continuous Deployment pipeline for the given demo application.

The requirements are as follows:

- Use Jenkins as your CI/CD tool. 
- Use Docker as your container technology.
- Setup a continuous deployment pipeline for the containerized demo application.
  - It should contain at least a testing and a deployment stage.

  - It should follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) workflow for the deployment.
- Setup a development environment which mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.
- Think about scalability and performance.
